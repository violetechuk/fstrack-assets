# FSTrack Assets
Due to the restrictions on how GPLv2 assets need to be distributed, this repository allows you to download and use (under the GPLv2 license) the GPLv2 assets we use in FSTrack.

The assets were originally taken and modified from https://github.com/ADSBexchange/tar1090. The SVG icons were extracted from markers.js and modified to suit FSTrack, along with some images for the altitude bar, aircraft silhouettes and country flags.
